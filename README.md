## Program Requirements

**Choose 5 out of the 8 options below to implement in your program**. Many of these should happen naturally based on your initial program design

- [ ] Has at least 3 elements you can interact with on the page (like buttons) with events
- [ ] Changes the text on a page for at least 1 element
- [ ] Changes the style of at least 1 element
- [ ] Changes an image on the webpage
- [ ] Adds/Removes/Toggles different classes
- [ ] Prompts the user at least once
- [ ] Uses at least 2 variables to keep track of data
- [ ] Uses mathematical operations to update variables based on user actions

## Getting Started

**Option 1**: One person clones this project into your Cloud9 environment using `git clone`, then you can work on this project using Pair Programming

**Option 2**: Both of you clone this project into your Cloud9 environment and you split up the work. Then, when Schneider returns, we learn how to combine the work back together. However, this does *not* mean you are doing separate projects - you each should have pieces that can combine back into the larger project.

## Keeping Track of Work

Schneider could have done a better job of preparing for this ahead of time, but please keep a _work log_ of what you work on each day. Keep track of the pieces you accomplish and who completes which task. Schneider will check this when you get back - it should act as a 'justification log' of your work while Schneider is gone.

## Last But Not Least

- I hope this is fun
- I look forward to seeing what you create when I'm gone
- Good luck =)
